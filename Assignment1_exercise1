Assignment #1 

Exercise 1. 
Write a function p having three arguments. The first one, l, is a mutable indexable object 
(e.g. a list or numpy array). The second  and third ones are integers, i and j.
Function p will rearrange in place the elements of  l in the range [i:j] (remember 
	in python ranges i is included, and j is not included), into two nonempty ranges
 [i:q] and [q:j] such that each element in l[i:q] is less than or equal to each element l[q:j]. 
 The index q is returned by this function.

def p(l,i,j):
 	p = j
 	b = i - 1
 	t = j

 	done = 0
 	while not done:
 		while not done:
 			b = b + 1
 			if b == t:
 				done = 1
 				break
 			if l[b] > l[p]:
 				list[t] = list[b]
 				break
 		while not done:
 			t = t-1
 			if t == b:
 				done = 1
 				break
 			if l[t] < l[p]:
 				l[b] = l[t]
 				break
 	return p
